- Time not specified - Received a message from Kiera exactly detailing egress volumes on the staging subnet  
- Time not specified - Checked traffic analyzer showing over 7GB of outbound traffic to cdn.nodeflux.ai in the last six hours, indicating significant data exfiltration activity  
- Time not specified - Discovered over 7GB of outbound traffic in the last six hours to cdn.nodeflux.ai, confirming ongoing exfiltration  
- Time not specified - During investigation, Matt discovered something worse—possible malicious activity or breach—while analyzing logs  
- Time not specified - Matt suggested checking DNS logs for unusual activity, suspecting command-and-control or data exfiltration attempts  
- Time not specified - Investigated internal DNS logs and confirmed unusual DNS requests, indicating potential covert communication or data exfiltration
