## üìö What This Project Does

This project processes a cybersecurity-themed textbook ("The Day Everything Slowed Down") and enables two intelligent tools:

- ‚ú® `SummarizeTool`: Generates a timeline summary using both **Refine** and **Map-Reduce** methods  
- ‚ùì `RagQATool`: Answers questions using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with ChromaDB and OpenAI embeddings

The system is evaluated using **RAGAS** on the following metrics:
- `Context Recall`
- `Context Precision`
- `Faithfulness`
- `Answer Correctness`

## üíº Business Problem

Security analysts often struggle to extract clear, time-based insights from long unstructured incident reports.  
Our solution:
- Automates summarization into a timeline
- Supports Q&A directly over raw text
- Benchmarks quality using LLM-based metrics
