The specific server involved in SMB traffic is not explicitly named, but it is implied that the traffic was related to the internal network segment connected to the west wing of the third floor, where the marketing workstations are located. Since the workstations are unused and the traffic was monitored via Wireshark, the server likely involved in SMB communication within that segment would be the relevant target.\n\n**Answer:** The internal marketing workstations located in the west wing of the third floor showed malformed SMB packets from switch sw-07b.",
